            <h3> Harry Potter is a film series based on the eponymous novels by J. K. Rowling</h3>
            <p>Harry Potter is the kind of timeless literary achievement that comes around once in a lifetime. Since the
                books have generated such a passionate following across the world, it was important to us to find a
                director
                that has an affinity for both children and magic. I can't think of anyone more ideally suited for this
                job
                than Chris [Columbus].
